# Movie Blind Test API

This project is a **Movie Blind Test** web application backend built with **FastAPI** inspired by [Themely](https://themely.se/days).<br>
It allows players to guess the movie or series from a piece of music each day, with dynamic hints and limited attempts. It includes an admin panel for managing the game, movies, and statistics.<br>
üîó The frontend repository is available here: [Melodissey's frontend](https://github.com/Pirant0409/Melodissey-front)

## üöÄFeatures

- üé∂ **Daily blind test Game**: Players are presented with a movie/series soundtrack every day and must guess the movie.
- üß© **Progressive Hints** ‚Äì The more attempts, the more clues
- üë• **Private Rooms** ‚Äì Play with friends in custom rooms
- üîß **Admin Panel**: Admin users can add, edit, or delete (comming soon) movies and view game statistics.
- üèÜ **Leaderboard**: Track the performance of all players (comming soon).
- üìä **Statistics**: Track guesses, total guesses, and success/failure for each day.

## üõ†Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: For building the backend REST API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with the database.
- **Pydantic**: For request validation and response models.
- **JWT Authentication**: For securing admin routes.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing and validating admin passwords.
- **SQLite** (or your chosen DB): For storing movies, guesses, and stats.
- [**TMDB API**](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) : Getting movies and tv shows' data
